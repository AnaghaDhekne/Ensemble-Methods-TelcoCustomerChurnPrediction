# Ensemble-Methods-TelcoCustomerChurnPrediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry by building an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and leveraging ensemble machine learning algorithms. The solution achieves a high prediction accuracy of **89.92%** through robust data engineering, feature engineering, and model optimization techniques.
